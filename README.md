## Key Features

- **3D Rendering**: DeskGenius utilizes Three Fiber (Three.js) to construct render 3D models of various desk components, implementing ray tracing, texture mapping, and advanced rendering algorithms. This optimizes computational efficiency and delivers a responsive, immersive UI experience.

- **Real-Time Preview**: Instantly reflects desk arrangement changes, enabling immediate visual feedback for quick decision-making.

- **Diverse Model Selection**: Offers a comprehensive range of desk models with regular additions.

## Technologies Used

- **Next.js**: Built with Next.js, leveraging server-side rendering, efficient routing, and enhanced performance.

- **Three Fiber (Three.js)**: Uses Three Fiber, a React renderer for Three.js, enabling interactive and complex 3D scenes.

- **drei**: Incorporates drei, a library of utilities and abstractions for @react-three/fiber, streamlining 3D development.

- **TailwindCSS**: Styled with Tailwind CSS for responsive and visually cohesive design, enhancing the customization experience.
